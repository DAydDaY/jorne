## Downloads

Version 1.0 has been already assembled and checked, everything works fine.

## Firmware

Compatible with [stock Corne firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd). The extra key can be snapped off. [Bluetooth firmware version](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/wiki/Corne-BLE) is in progress.

## PCB manufacturers

I recommend [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcbcb.com). New users gets $8 discount, so 5 black matte PCBs cost $9.88 total, including shipping.
