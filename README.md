# Jorne

Corne with an extra key

## Downloads

Version 2.0 has been already assembled and checked, everything works fine.

* [jorne-classic-2.0-gerbers.zip](https://github.com/joric/crkbd/raw/jorne/corne-classic/pcb/jorne-classic-1.0-gerbers.zip)

**WARNING** no mounting holes and ground zones in this revision (lost in conversion)!

There are also two **UNTESTED** revisions with an extra key, use at your own risk:

* [jorne-classic-2.1-gerbers.zip](https://github.com/joric/crkbd/raw/jorne/corne-classic/pcb/jorne-classic-2.1-gerbers.zip) (classic version, with mounting holes and ground planes)
* [jorne-cherry-2.1-gerbers.zip](https://github.com/joric/crkbd/raw/jorne-cherry/corne-cherry/pcb/jorne-cherry-2.1-gerbers.zip) (hotswap version, see [jorne-cherry](https://github.com/joric/crkbd/tree/jorne-cherry) branch)

## Firmware

Compatible with [stock Corne firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd). The extra key can be snapped off. [Bluetooth firmware version](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/wiki/Corne-BLE) is in progress.

## PCB manufacturers

I recommend [JLCPCB.com](https://jlcpcb.com). New users gets $8 discount, so 5 black matte PCBs cost $9.88 total, including shipping.
